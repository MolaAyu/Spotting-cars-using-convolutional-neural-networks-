# Spotting-cars-using-convolutional-neural-networks-

Purposes of the project:
* To practice the use of the Keras library for neural network development;
* To get some practical experience of working with image data and CNNs;
* To investigat overfitting in CNNs;
* To learn how to improve CNN using data augmentation and transfer learning tricks.

# Steps: 

1 -  Loading images from a directory
2 -  Training a convolutional neural network
3  - Data augmentation
4-  Applying a pre-trained convolutional neural network  ImageNet.
5 - Using VGG-16 as a feature extractor
6-  Visualizing the learned features
