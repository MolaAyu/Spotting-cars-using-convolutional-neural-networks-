Purposes of this project:
* practicing the use of the Keras library for neural network development;
* getting some practical experience of working with image data and CNNs;
* investigating overfitting in CNNs;
* learning how to improve CNN using data augmentation and transfer learning tricks.


Steps: 


1 -  Loading images from a directory
2 -  Training a convolutional neural network
3  - Data augmentation
4-  Applying a pre-trained convolutional neural network  ImageNet.
5 - Using VGG-16 as a feature extractor
6-  Visualizing the learned features
